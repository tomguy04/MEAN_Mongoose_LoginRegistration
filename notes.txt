Assignment: Login and Registration
Create a login and registration that uses back-end validation, catches errors, and displays them to the client.

Required Registration Fields:
email
first_name
last_name
password
password_confirm
birthday

Each registration field should have at least one back-end validation on it! Besides password_confirmation.

Email should use a unique:true as one of key:value pairs in the objects schema. 
How are we going to deal with uniqueness errors (note the error object from unique:true is different!)?

The login form should just have password and email

-1. create the db LoginReg
-2. create the Schema
    email
    first_name
    last_name
    password
    birthday

    2a. create the registration validations

-    first_name - required, at least 1 character
-    last_name - required, at least 1 character
-    password - required, at least 1 character
-    birthday  - required, at least 1 character
-     password should match pw confirmation

3. create a login form at the index.

    password
